[8]Getting Started With Expat

   Expat is a stream-oriented parser in which an application registers
   handlers for things the parser might find in the XML document (like
   start tags).

   An [9]introductory article on using Expat is available on [10]xml.com.

   There are also two examples coming with Expat (but they provide little
   background):
     * [11]elements.c
     * [12]outline.c

   For further reading, please consider:
     * [13]XML Security
     * [14]Common Pitfalls

   Compiled using [15]Pelican with theme [16]Chameleon on top of [17]
   Bootstrap
