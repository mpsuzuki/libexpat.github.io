   If you know of any additional resources which should be linked to from
   this page, please [9]open a bug for this website or [10]provide a pull
   request. We're especially interested in links open source interfaces to
   Expat from languages other than C.
     * Ada

     * AppleScript
          + [12]XML Tools 2 is an AppleScript scripting addition that
            allows AppleScript applications to work with XML data; it is
            based on Expat.

          + [13]bah.mod/expat.mod
     * C
          + [14]expat-dom -- Easy-to-use DOM interface written in C
          + The [15]Simple C Expat Wrapper is a wrapper around Expat that
            provides a light-weight object model somewhat like a DOM.
     * C++
          + [16]ExpatMM -- C++ interface to Expat
          + [17]C++ Wrappers for the Expat XML Parser, an article by Tim
            Smith providing object-oriented wrappers for Expat. The
            wrappers use some MFC-biased naming, but look interesting.
          + [18]Arabica -- an XML Parser toolkit for C++ programmers, with
            SAX2 implementations based on several parsers, including
            Expat.

            the [22]SAX for .NET specifications.
     * Eiffel
          + The [23]GOBO project is working on an Eiffel binding for
            Expat. Development is active and the package is fully
            supported in GOBO 3.0 and 3.1, though there isn't much status
            information about the Expat bindings on the website. (Most
            activity is reportedly on the relevant mailing lists.)

            library
     * Lua
          + [28]LuaExpat is a wrapper around Expat for the [29]Lua
            programming language. The [30]LuaSOAP library is a [31]SOAP
            implementation built on top of [32]LuaExpat.
