[8]How to contribute to this website

   Cool that you found your way here: We appreciate your help with
   improving this website! This page is meant to document how to do that
   well.

Basics

   This website is maintained using
     * [9]Markdown syntax files for articles
     * [10]Pelican (and theme [11]Chameleon) to render HTML from Markdown
     * [12]Pull requests against Git repository [13]
       libexpat/libexpat.github.io on GitHub

   To render the website with your changes applied, running make should
   just work.

   When making commits, please exclude changes to HTML files so we can
   focus on the interesting bits during review.

   Thanks!

Adding new pages

   To add new pages, please:
    1. Add a new file content/pages/UPCOMING-TITLE.md.
    2. Integrate links to that new article at the news listing
       (content/pages/news.md) and the "Latest News" section at the front
       page (content/pages/welcome.md).

   We are looking forward to your contribution!

   The Expat development team

   Compiled using [14]Pelican with theme [15]Chameleon on top of [16]
   Bootstrap
